# Dory's Notes

The notes app that doesn't remember. A group project for Makers Academy built in pure javascript to learn Single Page App behaviour, including writing our own testing framework. Only external library is a cheeky bit of jQuery used for the CSS bubbles. 

## Run this yourself

#### Mac OS
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/zi-codes/Note
$ cd Note
```
Then open index.html in your favourite browser (preferably Chrome)

## User stories implemented


```
As a programmer
I can see a list of my notes, where each note is abbreviated to the first 20 characters
So I can find the one I want
```

```
As a programmer
I can create a new note
So I can record something I need to remember
```

```
As a programmer
I can see the full text of an individual note on its own page
So I can see all the information in the note
```

(NB: notes do not need to be permanently stored.  If the user refreshes their web page, they'll lose their notes, and that's fine.)
